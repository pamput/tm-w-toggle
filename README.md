# tm-w-toggle

This is a simple (and not really clever) TamperMonkey script to benefit from the `w=1` url flag in GitHub.

This script introduces two keyboard shortcuts you'll be able to use when in a Pull Request comparison view:

- *w*: toggle from the two modes
- *W*: toggle the `w=1` mode as default
